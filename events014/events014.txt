 July 13, 2013 Raspberry Pi Meet-up

When:  07/13/2013 11:00 AM
Where:  Lima Public Library, 650 W Market St, Lima, OH

What is a Raspberry Pi?

LRITA.org and the Lima LUG will be hosting a Raspberry Pi user group meet-up
on Saturday, July 13, at the Lima Public Library.

 “The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and
a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many things.” The
Pi has found its way into some amazing DIY projects.

This event is a great opportunity to meet with other RPi users in the area to
share ideas and projects. And if RPi is new to you, come learn what the RPi is
all about!

If you do not have a RPi, you might even win one! Thanks to LRITA.org, we will
be giving away (3) 512MB RPi Model B Rev. 2 boards.

Attendees will receive an LRITA.org flash drive and a pizza lunch.

Registration is FREE! Please register below.
