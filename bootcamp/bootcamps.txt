bOver 200 children turned up with 100 adults to the first Raspberry Pi Boot Camp to learn more about what they can do with the Pi. From controlling remote control cars and LEDS to setting up a home media server – the children learned how to use the Raspberry Pi to make things!
Volunteers and enthusiasts gave up their time to demonstrate what is possible with the Pi. The event was organised by The University of Bristol and the British Computer Society, and sponsored by RS Components, Motorola Foundation, Sonardyne and At-Bristol who hosted the event. Marcus Bartley aged 12 commented "This was fantastic. My Pi has been at home in its box for a while but I’ve now learned loads of cool things to do with it. Me and my mates are looking forward to the next one already!" The events will become a regular feature at At-Bristol on a Saturday in September, November, January, March and May.
Volunteers, enthusiast and students from the University of Bristol did an excellent job of delivering a number of demonstrations and workshops to a range of abilities from beginner to advance. The show and tell section gave visitors the opportunity to learn more about expert level projects. Due to the concentration of high-tech industry based in the south-west we are very lucky to have access to a network of keen enthusiasts who are willing to share their knowledge and experience. 
The Pi-Cars proved to be very popular with Barnaby Kent and team helping children to build a remote control handset for a Car using their Raspberry Pi. Matthew Venn held a workshop to show how the Pi could be used to log data to the internet. The Magpi team, Tim Cox and Colin Deady, held a drop in table for advice and a multi-coloured LED workshop. Steve Battle brought along a number of robots controlled by a Raspberry Pi which sparked a lot of interest with the children. One of the future events in 2013 will be focussed on robots.
People turning up for the event come with their Pi but not always a monitor, keyboard and mouse. The Boot Camp therefore provided access to this equipment. The children were also encouraged to turn up with a laptop and there were volunteers on hand to show them how to set up their laptop to control their Pi.
Another lesson learned from running the first Boot Camp is the number of people who have a Pi that they have never used. For the less experienced users another group of students held a drop-in clinic that proved to be popular throughout the day. A number of people came with their unopened Pi and left with Minecraft installed and the confidence to continue with the Pi at home.

Students from the University of Bristol also made a huge contribution to the success of the day running workshops as well as the drop-in centre. Third year students Sam Walder and Jeremy Dalton held a very successful Pi interfacing workshop where children learned how to control LEDs using the GPIO pins on their Pi boards. Students Matt Oates, Adam Sardar and Ben Smithers ran a workshop where the children created a Home Media Server using remote access to their Raspberry Pi. 
The first two events relied heavily on the goodwill of volunteers. To ensure the sustainability of future events we will be asking for donations and sponsorship to cover the costs of volunteers parking, components and printing etc Future Boot Camps will continue the theme of workshops and demonstrations on the Pi and other platforms like Arduino. However, other aspects of computing will also be covered. For example, the Boot Camp on June 15th will feature a 'Rails Girls'workshop,  hosted by local web agency Simpleweb. Female programmers are invited to spend the day learning Ruby on Rails.In addition to three 90 minute workshops which aim to introduce children to application writing using the language Processing. Steve will cover the basics of variables, conditionals, loops and functions with the aim of developing a game by the end of the workshop. This will help the children prepare for a free one week programming course to be held at The University of Bristol as part of a national competition organised the Young Rewired State. 
The Bristol Raspberry Pi Boot Camps are tapping into the natural enthusiasm of children to become the digital makers of the future. Since the government proposed the planned updates to the IT curriculum last year there has been a growing interest in the subject from children, parents and teachers.  These events aim to support the learning of the next generation of innovators and engineers, whilst providing a fun day out for the family.
