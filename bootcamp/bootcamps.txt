Raspberry Pi Boot Camp events are now being held on a regular basis in the south west of the UK. The MagPi asked Mike Bartley, organiser of the Bristol event, to tell us all about the events and how they came about, hopefully to inspire similar events elsewhere.
In December 2012 the Bristol branch of British Institute for IT (BCS) held its annual talk to encourage children into computing. The venue was At-Bristol and the theme was the Raspberry Pi. With an inspirational talk from Rob Bishop of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the event attracted over 450 attendees with at least 300 being children. Since the UK government proposed the planned updates to the IT curriculum last year there has been a growing interest in the subject from children, parents and teachers. It was clear we had hit a topic of high interest and we needed to understand how best to take it forward.
Both the University of Bristol and At-Bristol have outreach programs to encourage children into computing and engineering. A collaboration between the three organisations seemed like a perfect way to collectively achieve our goals; to create a series of events which support the learning of the next generation of innovators and engineers, whilst providing a fun day out for the family. 
At-Bristol provides the facilities and logistics; the University of Bristol’s students run a drop in clinic and workshops as well as loaning equipment. The BCS put a call out to their members to find volunteers who run workshops and demonstrations. All three made financial contributions of some sort. The voluntary "let's do this" attitude pervaded the organisation and the event and enabled the three organisations to work together to pull off the first two events, which proved to be hugely successful.
Over 400 children and 200 adults attended the first two Raspberry Pi Boot Camps to learn what they can do with the Pi. From controlling remote control cars and LEDs to setting up a home media server – the children got to grips with how they can use the Raspberry Pi to make things! 
Marcus Bartley aged 12 commented "This was fantastic. My Pi has been at home in its box for a while but I’ve now learned loads of cool things to do with it. Me and my mates are looking forward to the next one already!" The events will now become a regular feature at At-Bristol on a Saturday in September, November, January, March and May.
The workshops ranged from beginner to advance level, and also included a show-and-tell section that gave visitors the opportunity to learn more about expert level projects. Pi-Cars proved to be very popular workshop; children had the opportunity to build remote control handset for a Car using their Raspberry Pi. Other workshops included the Pi as a home media server, led traffic lights and how to log data to the internet. The Magpi team were on hand to answer questions. The show-and- tell section included a number of robots controlled by a Raspberry Pi and a drawing robot.
Obviously organising a large scale event of this nature throws up many challenges, finding enough equipment has been the main issue. We asked people to bring their own monitors, keyboards and power cables, which of course isn’t always possible. We encouraged visitors bring their laptops and there were volunteers on hand to show them how to set up their laptop to control their Pi.
Future Boot Camps will continue the theme of workshops and demonstrations on the Pi and other platforms like Arduino. However, other aspects of computing will also be covered. For example, the second Boot Camp on June 15th featured a 'Rails Girls' workshop, hosted by local web agency Simpleweb. Female programmers were invited to spend the day learning Ruby on Rails. In addition to this we ran three 90 minute workshops which aimed to introduce children to application writing using the language Processing. The basics of variables, conditionals, loops and functions with the aim of developing a game by the end of the workshop. This will help the children prepare for a free one week programming course to be held at the University of Bristol as part of a national competition organised by the Young Rewired State. 
Going forward the three organisations will continue to work together as all objectives remain completely aligned. It is clear that collaboration like this has been extremely beneficial in enabling us to achieve our goals. Events will be held over five Saturdays each year and there will be themes (such as Wireless, Robotics, and smart homes) to keep the events fresh. The first two events relied heavily on the goodwill of volunteers. Now that we have organised two successful boot camps we need to ensure the event is sustainable by asking for donations and sponsorship. We would like to buy dedicated equipment and cover the costs incurred by volunteers. If you would like to contribute to future events by providing a workshop, being part of the show-and-tell section or by making a donation, please contact caroline.higgins@bristol.ac.uk
