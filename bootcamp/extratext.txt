In December 2012 the BCS in Bristol held its annual talk to encourage children into computing. The venue was @Bristol and the theme was the Raspberry Pi with an inspirational talk from Rob Bishop of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and a number of other speakers describing their Pi projects. The vent attracted over 450 attendees with at least 300 being children. It was clear we had hit a topic of high interest and we needed to understand how best to take it forward.

Both the University of Bristol and @Bristol had outreach programs to encourage children into computing and engineering so both were motivated to work with the BCS to build on the initial successful event. @Bristol were able to provide the facilities and logistics. The University of Bristol provided equipment and students who could both help people get started with their Pi and more advanced workshops. The BCS were able to use their contacts to find volunteers for more advanced workshops and demonstrations. All three made financial contributions of some sort. The voluntary "let's do this" attitude pervaded the organisation and the event and enabled the three organisations to work together to pull off the first two very successful events.

Going forward the three organsiations will continue to work together as all objectives remain completely aligned. Events will be held over five Saturdays each year and there will be themes (such as Wireless, Robotics, and smart homes) to keep the events fresh. Now that two successful Bootcamps have been held it is now possible to encourage corporate funding and Infineon have already contributed. (link for Infineon is http://www.infineon.com/)
